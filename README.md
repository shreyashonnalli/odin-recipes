# Odin Recipes
This is my first ever html website with some basic css formatting. Data was collected from a recipe website and I have published ingredients and steps to make each recipe on my website. The home page contains links to the other pages which will show the recipes. The homepage currently has 2 recipes. More recipes will be added as time goes on.
